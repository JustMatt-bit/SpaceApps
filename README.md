# SpaceApps-Star Mould

During the entirety of the two days given, our team have extensively researched and engineered a solution to the given problem - to look at the cosmos not only from a scientific standpoint, where everything is based on rules and maths, but to shine a light on it from a artistic standpoint, where we give the reigns of creativity to an imperfect artificial intelligence. To realize such an idea in just a mere two days, we had to research the different kinds of AI image generation models and decided to use Stable Diffusion - an open source project perfect for our needs. However, we did not have the resources necessary to run such a project locally from our computers, as the resources needed to run the AI model were far out of our reach. Instead, we decided to use cloud computing, using API’s to communicate with a version of Stable Diffusion running on a web server to give prompts and reference images and receive the results. We decided to give the user a choice of pictures, loaded directly from NASA’s image API’s and let them pick which image to use as a reference for the prompt. By giving all the choice to the user, we let people expand their creativity beyond their own minds and explore space in a way not a single other person will, as it is practically impossible to create identical images due to the variety of prompts, input images and neural networks of each .
